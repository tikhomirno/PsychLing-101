"""Preprocessing for Zemla, Cao, Mueller & Austerweil (2020), Behavior Research Methods.

Semantic fluency: participants named as many members of a cued category as they
could within a fixed time, repeatedly, across nine rounds.

Input : original_data/from_github/fluency_data/snafu_sample.csv
Output: processed_data/exp1.csv  Experiment1 -- animals, fruits, vegetables
        processed_data/exp2.csv  Experiment3 -- animals, foods, tools

Mind the numbering: the output files are named for their position in this
contribution, not for the collection they hold. `exp2.csv` holds the collection
the source file calls Experiment3. There is no file for Experiment2 -- see
EXCLUDED_GROUP below.

Within the two retained collections nothing is filtered out. Responses whose
timing cannot be trusted are marked with flags so that downstream analyses can
exclude them explicitly.
