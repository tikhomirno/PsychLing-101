In the following study, you will see 55 different expressions such as face room. Please indicate, for each expression, what you think it means.\n
More specifically, your task is to choose, for each expression, one of sixteen different relations connecting the two words. You can use the following table to get familiar with these relations and some examples:\n
\n

word2 ABOUT word1\tnewsflash\tflash ABOUT news\n

word2 USED BY word1\ttwitchcraft\tcraft USED BY witch(es)\n
\n
For example, you could interpret face room as, among others, room HAS face (a magical room with a large living face on its wall), or room FOR face (the make-up artist room at a film set). Please only select one possible interpretation for each expression - the one that seems most likely to you. Of course, there are no correct or wrong answers in this task.\n
If you want to have a look at this table during the study, you can open it in a new tab using the following link:\n
