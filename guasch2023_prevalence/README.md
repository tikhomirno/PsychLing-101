# Description
- Participants judged whether each of the 120 letter strings in a session corresponded to a word they knew in Catalan, or whether it was a pseudoword. Responses were binary (“yes”/“no”).
- The dataset comprises 24,557,400 data points, with 120 trials per session across 204,645 sessions, including 40,777 distinct Catalan words and 30,243 pseudowords. In each session, a 70/30 ratio was used (i.e., 84 words and 36 pseudowords).
- The dataset includes sociolinguistic information about participants.
