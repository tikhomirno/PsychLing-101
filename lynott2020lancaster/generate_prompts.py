Generate LLM prompts for Lynott et al. (2020) Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms.

Reads processed_data/exp1.csv (Perception) and exp2.csv (Action) and writes
prompts.jsonl.zip (one line per participant per chunk of up to MAX_TRIALS_PER_PROMPT trials).

Each prompt represents a session chunk from one participant, starting with the
original task instructions followed by trial-by-trial data.

Human responses are marked with << >> as required by PsychLing-101 format.
