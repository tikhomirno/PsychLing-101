    For example, airport is an existing word, while saddleolive does not exist in the English language. Please respond as fast, but most importantly as accurately as possible. \n
    We sincerely want to ask you to be as diligent as possible in making these judgements. For our study, we cannot analyse data only consisting of random answers. \n
    You will see these words one after another. If you the word presented to you exists, press the {choices[0]} key on your keyboard. If the word does not exist, press the {choices[1]} key. You are free to write these button assignments down if it helps you remembering them. \n
    The study will not continue unless you give a response. Thus, if you want to pause the study, you can delay your response until you want to continue. \n
    By pressing the ESC key, you will end the fullscreen mode. This does not hinder you from continuing the experiment, but you cannot switch back to fullscreen mode. If possible, we want to ask you to stay in fullscreen mode for the whole duration of the experiment. \n"""
