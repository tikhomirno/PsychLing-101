    # Information from the manuscript:
    # The sequence of events during each naming trial was as follows: (a) three asterisks were presented at the center of the screen for 250 msec; (b) a 50-msec tone was then presented indicating the onset of the next trial; (c) a 250-msec dark interval was presented; (d) the target word was presented centered at the same location the asterisks were presented; (e) the participant named the word; (f) the computer detected the voice onset; (g) the word remained on the screen for an additional 250 msec after voice onset; (h) the word was erased from the screen. If the response latency for the vocal response was less than 4,000 msec, a screen appeared asking the participant to manually code the accuracy of their response. The four choices were 1) correct pronunciation, 2) uncertain of pronunciation, 3) mispronunciation, and 4) microphone error. Participants were instructed beforehand regarding the importance and use of these coding options.

After you've said the word, you must indicate whether you pronounced it correctly, are uncertain of the pronunciation, pronounced it incorrectly, or if a microphone error occured. It is very important that you label your responses to the best of your knowledge, as this information will be used in the data analysis."
