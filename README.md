# PsychLing-101

PsychLing-101 is a community-driven effort to compile a database of psycholinguistic data. 

Our goals are:

1. Organize and make available psycholinguistic data by converting existing data into a unified, standardized format.
2. Convert psycholinguistic data into a format that can be used to fine-tune and evaluate large language models (LLMs).
3. Collaboratively produce an article describing the database to be sent to a psycholinguistic or interdisciplinary outlet.  

The project is led by [Taisiia Tikhomirova](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/taisiia-tikhomirova) and [Dirk U. Wulff](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/staff/dirk-wulff) at the Center for Adaptive Rationality at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development and supported by: [Valentin Kriegmair](https://www.mpib-berlin.mpg.de/person/valentin-kriegmair/171978) (MPI for Human Development), [Fritz Günther](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/mitarbeiter/1693894) (Humboldt University), [Aliona Petrenco](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/mitarbeiter/1694954) (Humboldt University), [Louis Schiekiera](https://www.psychologie.hu-berlin.de/de/mitarbeiter/1696407) (Humboldt University), [Marco Marelli](https://www.marcomarelli.net/) (University of Milano-Bicocca), and [Marcel Binz](https://marcelbinz.github.io/) (Helmholtz Munich). 

PsychLing-101 will be open for contributions until May 1st, 2026. Future projects may follow.

## Participation rules

1. **Co‑authorship** – All data contributors will be co‑authors on the final paper.
2. **Immediate openness** – By contributing, you agree that the dataset becomes publicly available under the project license upon merge.
3. **Publication restrictions** – You may not publish analyses based on PsychLing‑101 data until the official paper is released.
4. **Contact first** – Open an issue or email us **before** you start working on a dataset (see below).

## Data scope and inclusion criteria

We welcome a broad range of psycholinguistic paradigms. For the list of datasets currently being processed and datasets that are open for contribution, please consult [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/Data-X01/PsychLing-101/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). 

Each submission is evaluated individually, and we’re happy to discuss edge cases or special formats!
Key guidelines: 

### Scope

1. The study must primarily investigate **language processing** (e.g., lexical access, sentence comprehension, priming). More details and examples can be found in [SCOPE.md](https://github.com/Data-X01/PsychLing-101/blob/main/SCOPE.md). 
2. **Multilingual** datasets are allowed, but metadata and variable names, participant IDs, etc. must be in English.
3. EEG, fMRI, MEG, eye-tracking or other continuous behavioural/physiological signals are welcome if exported in a row-wise CSV format (one observation per time-point or trial).
4. **Images** may be included; **audio/video** are not (yet) supported.

### Minimum requirements

1. Data must include raw, trial-level information (no aggregated results).
2. Data must be convertible into a structured, text‑based format.
3. Contributors should ensure that they have the legal permission to share all materials, including stimuli (e.g., images or texts). Using copyrighted stimuli in a controlled lab setting is often permissible, but publishing them online may require additional rights or licenses.

# How to contribute

## 0. Check & сontact 

1. Read **CONTRIBUTING.md** to make sure no one is already processing your dataset.
2. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/Data-X01/PsychLing-101/issues/new/choose) (*or* email [psychling101@gmail.com](mailto:psychling101@gmail.com)) describing the dataset.

## 1. Fork the repository

In the upper‑right corner of the project page, click **Fork ▸ Create fork**.

## 2. Clone & create a feature branch

You will now clone your fork (not the original repository) to your local machine and create a new branch for your dataset.
Open your command-line interface (Terminal, Git Bash, or PowerShell). 

```bash

# 1. Clone your fork to the local machine
# This creates a folder named 'PsychLing-101'. Remember to replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub handle.
Please clone the repository with LFS files untracked. 
GIT_LFS_SKIP_SMUDGE=1 git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/PsychLing-101.git

# 2. Move into the cloned repository folder
cd PsychLing-101

# 3. Create & switch to a new feature branch named after your dataset using the format `authorYEAR_title` (e.g., `smith2000_priming`)
# All your work for this contribution will be done inside this branch.
git checkout -b <authorYEAR_title>
```

## 3. Prepare your dataset

In Steps 3.1 – 3.4 you transform the raw files of the original_data into standardized CSVs and then generate participant-level LLM prompts.

### 3.1. Organise raw data 

1. Inside the PsychLing-101 folder you just cloned, create the new experiment folder using the format `authorYEAR_title` (e.g., `smith2000_priming`). This is where all your dataset files will reside.
2. Inside the main folder, create a subfolder named `original_data/`.
3. Place **all raw files** into `original_data/`. If your data are in a proprietary format, export them to one of the open formats before committing.

```
<authorYEAR_title>/
└──  original_data/    ← **all** raw source files (.csv, .xlsx, .mat, …)
```

### 3.2. Preprocess raw data 

1. Create a script named preprocess_data.py or preprocess_data.R in the root of your experiment folder (next to original_data/).

2. Inside the script:

- Read every file inside original_data/.

- Tidy the data: rename or recode columns so they match the canonical names in [CODEBOOK.csv](https://github.com/Data-X01/PsychLing-101/blob/main/CODEBOOK.csv). If a required variable is missing, first add it to CODEBOOK.csv with a short description.

- Write one or more cleaned files (exp1.csv, exp2.csv, …) into a new processed_data/ folder. 

```
<authorYEAR_title>/
├── original_data/        # unmodified raw files
├── preprocess_data.py (or preprocess_data.R)    # conversion script (runs in < 60 s if possible)
├── processed_data/       # tidy CSVs (exp*.csv)
└── CODEBOOK.csv          # reference for standardized column names
```

### 3.3. Generate LLM prompts

1. In the experiment folder, create a script named `generate_prompts.py (or generate_prompts.R)` (for the example, see [guenther2024associations_sentences_texts/generate_prompts.py](https://github.com/marcelbinz/Psych-201/blob/main/guenther2024associations_sentences_texts/generate_prompts.py)).
2. This script should:
- Read the standardized CSV file(s).
- Generate a JSONL file (`prompts.jsonl`) with one line per participant.
- Each prompt should:
   - Represent an entire session from one participant.
   - Include trial-by-trial data.
   - Begin with the instructions. Use original instructions, if available.
   - Mark human responses or continuous behavioural outcomes with `<< >>` (do not use these symbols elsewhere).  
   - For discrete choice tasks, randomize the naming of options per participant (see [binz2022heuristics/generate_prompts.py](https://github.com/marcelbinz/Psych-201/tree/main/binz2022heuristics/generate_prompts.py)).
   - Stay within a 32K token limit per participant.
   - If the trial includes an image, follow the formatting guidelines in step 3.4. 

In resulting `prompts.jsonl.zip` each line should have the following three fields:
- `"text"`: Full natural language prompt with instructions, cover story and trial-by-trial data.
- `"experiment"`: Identifier for the experiment.
- `"participant_id"`: Participant ID.
- Optional metadata fields (if available):
   - `"rt"`: List of reaction times in ms.
   - `"age"`, `"diagnosis"`, `"nationality"`, or questionnaire-derived statistics.
   
Example A – Discrete choice (lexical decision)
~~~
In this task, you will see two words at a time. If both words are REAL ENGLISH words, you press the button \"a\". If ONE or BOTH words are non-sense words (for example \"FLUMMOL\"), you press the button \"l\". Respond within 2 seconds.

Trial 1: The word pair is 'table' and 'mirror'. You press <<a>>. Correct.
Trial 2: The word pair is 'flummol' and 'mirror'. You press <<l>>. Correct.
Trial 3: The word pair is 'glonch' and 'smarp'. You press <<l>>. Correct.
Trial 4: The word pair is 'planet' and 'flower'. You press <<a>>. Correct.
Trial 5: The word pair is 'snarp' and 'blonk'. You press <<l>>. Correct.
Trial 6: The word pair is 'dog' and 'fleeb'. You press <<l>>. Correct.
Trial 7: The word pair is 'sun' and 'cloud'. You press <<a>>. Correct.
Trial 8: The word pair is 'cheef' and 'grass'. You press <<l>>. Correct.
~~~

Example B – Continuous outcome (self‑paced reading)
~~~
You will read each sentence word-by-word; press SPACE to reveal the next word. Try to read naturally.

Trial 1:
  Word 1: ‘The’       <<245>> ms 
  Word 2: ‘cat’       <<198>> ms
  Word 3: ‘sat’       <<184>> ms
  Word 4: ‘on’        <<171>> ms
  Word 5: ‘the’       <<165>> ms
  Word 6: ‘mat’       <<213>> ms

Trial 2:
  Word 1: ‘A’         <<231>> ms
  Word 2: ‘dog’       <<204>> ms
  Word 3: ‘barked’    <<190>> ms
~~~

```

└── prompts.jsonl.zip ← a zipped JSONL file with prompts. 
```


### 3.4. (Optional) Images

If your dataset includes images:

1. Prepare a lower-resolution version (PNG or JPEG only; ≤ 100 KB each) of the images to minimize file size. Contact us if this limit is problematic for your stimuli. 

2. Place all relevant images into a single folder and compress them into a images.zip file.

3. In your CSV file (e.g., exp1.csv), add a column named image_filename that matches each trial’s image (e.g., apple.jpg, scene1.png).

4. In generate_prompts.py, insert the <image> token wherever the picture appeared, e.g.:

~~~
Trial 1: <image> You press <<a>>.
~~~

5. In your README.md, briefly describe:

- How images were used in the experiment (e.g., as stimuli, options, or cues)

- Any preprocessing applied to reduce image resolution or format

## 4. Final folder checklist 

Before opening a pull request, confirm all of the following:

### Files present
* [ ] `README.md` with citation and data source link
* [ ] `original_data/`
* [ ] `processed_data/` (`exp1.csv`, `exp2.csv`, …)
* [ ] `CODEBOOK.csv`
* [ ] `preprocess_data.py (or preprocess_data.R)`
* [ ] `generate_prompts.py (or generate_prompts.R)`
* [ ] `prompts.jsonl.zip`
* [ ] *(optional)* `images.zip`

### Validation 
* [ ] `preprocess_data.py (or preprocess_data.R)` runs without errors *from a clean repo clone*.
* [ ] Generated CSVs follow the column names in `CODEBOOK.csv`.
* [ ] `generate_prompts.py (or generate_prompts.R)` produces `prompts.jsonl` without exceeding 32 K tokens per participant.

## 5. Commit, push & open a pull request

⚠️ Large‑file warning!
GitHub rejects individual files ≥ 100 MB unless they are stored with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). If any file in your experiment folder is ≥ 100 MB (for example images.zip), you need to track it with [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). For this follow the "Optional" steps in the code snippet below. 

```bash

# OPTIONAL - Command Git LFS to track large CSV files
# Since this project deals with large data files, we track all CSV and ZIP files 
# to ensure those that exceed the 100 MB GitHub limit are handled correctly.
# NOTE: This command only needs to be run once per repository.
git lfs track "*.csv"
git lfs track "*.zip"

# OPTIONAL - Stage the LFS configuration file
# This adds the LFS tracking setup to Git
git add .gitattributes

# 1. Stage the entire experiment folder
# This prepares all your new files and scripts for commit
git add <authorYEAR_title>

# 2. Create a commit (A descriptive message is mandatory)
git commit -m "Add <authorYEAR_title> dataset and preprocess scripts"

# 3. Push the branch to your fork on GitHub
git push -u origin <authorYEAR_title>
```

Next, navigate to **Your fork on GitHub**. You should see a banner or button prompting you to create a **Pull Request** from your new branch into the main branch of the original **Data-X01/PsychLing-101** repository. Fill in a short description of your contribution and click **Create pull request**.

A project maintainer will run the checks and leave comments directly in your pull requests. Small fixes can be pushed to the same branch; the pull request updates automatically.
