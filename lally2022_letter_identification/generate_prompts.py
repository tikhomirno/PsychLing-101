"""Turn the processed Lally & Rastle (2022) trials into one prompt per participant.

Reads
-----
processed_data/exp1.csv
    The tidy trial table written by preprocess_data.py.

Writes
------
prompts.jsonl.zip
    One JSON object per line, one line per participant, with the fields text,
    experiment, participant_id, rt and exposure_duration_ms. The uncompressed
    prompts.jsonl is written first and removed once it has been compressed.

Rendering the task in text
--------------------------
The instruction lines are reproduced verbatim from the experiment script,
including the button box and the spacebar: the prompt describes the situation
the participant was actually in. Only the blank lines between them are inferred,
from the <ln> screen geometry described at INSTRUCTION_LINES below. Nothing is
added to the wording, and the exposure duration, which the instructions never
mention, is carried as a field of the record rather than written into the text.

The letter string is given in full, as it was displayed. The prompt is a
transcript of what was on the screen, not of what the participant managed to
take in: 'snow' really was presented, and that it went by too fast to read is a
fact about their perception rather than about the display. This is the same
reasoning that keeps the button box and the spacebar in the instructions.

Both measured quantities are marked with << >>: the letter the participant
chose and the time they took. The exposure duration is constant within a
session, so it is stated once between the instruction and the first trial
instead of being repeated on every line.

No feedback is shown after a trial. The DMDX script sets <nfb>, so participants
were never told whether a response was correct, and the prompts must not tell a
model either. This departs from the worked example in the repository README,
whose experiment did give feedback.

Which candidate letter appeared above and which below is not recorded in the
results file, so the order the two options are offered in is randomised per
participant, from a seed derived from the participant identifier. Re-running the
script therefore reproduces the archive byte for byte.

All paths are relative: run the script from this contribution folder.
