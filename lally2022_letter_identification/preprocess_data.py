"""Preprocessing script for Lally & Rastle (2022) Letter Identification.

Study
-----
Lally, C., & Rastle, K. (2022). Orthographic and feature-level contributions to
letter identification. Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology, 75(9).

Reicher-Wheeler task: a letter string is flashed, masked, and then two candidate
letters appear above and below one position of the mask. Participants report
which of the two occurred in the string, so chance performance is 50%. The design
is 3 (orthographic status: word, pseudoword, consonant string) x 2 (visual
overlap between the two candidate letters: high, low), fully within participants.
72 participants x 144 trials = 10368 observations over 48 items, each item built
in three orthographic versions.

Reads
-----
original_data/Data & Analyses/FeatureCuesResults.csv
    Trial-level results. Two DMDX conventions matter here: the reaction time of
    an incorrect response is stored with a negative sign, and the five-digit item
    code packs the whole design into its digits -- list, orthographic status,
    visual overlap, item number (see check_results).
original_data/Stimuli & Experiments/FeatureCuesStimuli.xlsx
    Sheet "StimuliSummary": the 48 items in their three orthographic versions,
    each with a high- and a low-overlap alternative string, plus letter-similarity
    ratings. Worksheet row order is the item number (first row = item 1).

Writes
------
processed_data/exp1.csv
    One row per trial, in the columns documented in CODEBOOK.csv.

Nothing inside original_data/ is written to or modified. Every consistency check
below raises before anything is written, so a partial or silently wrong output
file cannot be produced.
